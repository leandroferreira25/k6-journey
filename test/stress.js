// === Stress - Load Testing ===
// https://k6.io/docs/test-types/stress-testing/

//! Note that a stress test doesn't overwhelm the system immediatelyâ€”that's a spike test, which is covered in the next section.
// Classic examples of a need for stress testing are Black Friday or Cyber Monday, two days each year that generate multiple times the normal traffic for many websites.

//! NO PROD, We recommend running a stress test in a UAT or staging environment.
